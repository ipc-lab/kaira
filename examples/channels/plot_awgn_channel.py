Simulating AWGN Channels with Kaira
===========================================

This example demonstrates the usage of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel
in the Kaira library. AWGN is one of the most common communication channel models,
which adds Gaussian noise to the input signal.

We'll visualize how different noise levels (SNR) affect signal transmission.

# Imports and Setup
# -------------------------------
# We start by importing the necessary modules and setting up the environment.

# Create Sample Signal
# ------------------------------------
# Let's create a sample signal to pass through our AWGN channels.
# We'll use a sine wave as our input signal.

# Generate time points

# Conclusion
# ------------------
# This example demonstrated how to use the AWGNChannel in Kaira to simulate noisy
# signal transmission with different SNR levels. We also used Kaira's metrics to evaluate
# the actual SNR and PSNR of the transmitted signals.
#
# Key observations:
# - Lower SNR values result in higher noise levels and greater signal distortion
# - The AWGNChannel accurately models the specified SNR levels
# - The PSNR is higher than SNR, as expected for this type of signal
# - MSE follows the theoretical inverse relationship with SNR
#
# The AWGNChannel is widely used in communication system modeling because AWGN
# is a good first approximation for many real-world noisy channels.
