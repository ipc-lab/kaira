## Style Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding standards
- Use [NumPy docstring format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments for complex logic, but prioritize readable code

## Documentation

- Update documentation alongside code changes
- For new features, include:
  - API documentation
  - Usage examples
  - Implementation notes if helpful for users

## Creating Examples

Kaira uses an automated example gallery system that makes it easy to add new examples without manual maintenance of index files.

### Adding New Examples

1. **File Naming**: Use the `plot_` prefix for all examples (e.g., `plot_my_feature.py`)

2. **Location**: Place examples in the appropriate category directory under `examples/`

3. **Docstring Format**: Use the following format at the top of your example:

   ```python
   """
   ==========================================
   Clear and Descriptive Title
   ==========================================

   Comprehensive description explaining what the example demonstrates,
   key concepts covered, and expected outcomes.

   Additional paragraphs can provide more detail about implementation
   specifics, theoretical background, or usage notes.
   """
   ```

4. **Structure**: Follow the template in `examples/template_example.py`

### Automated Index Generation

The system automatically:

- Discovers all `plot_*.py` files in example directories
- Extracts titles and descriptions from docstrings
- Generates `index.rst` files for each category
- Maintains synchronization during documentation builds
- Updates example galleries automatically via pre-commit hooks when example files are modified

**No manual index.rst editing required!** The example gallery indices are automatically updated whenever you commit changes to example files through pre-commit hooks.

### Development Tools

Use the example workflow script for development:

```bash
# Preview examples in a category
python scripts/example_workflow.py preview --category modulation

# Sync all example galleries
python scripts/example_workflow.py sync

# Validate example format
python scripts/example_workflow.py validate --file examples/modulation/plot_new_example.py
```

### Example Categories

Examples are organized into categories:

- `channels` - Channel models for wireless communications
- `modulation` - Digital modulation schemes
- `metrics` - Performance metrics and evaluation tools
- `models` - Neural network models and architectures
- `models_fec` - Forward Error Correction models
- And more...

For detailed information, see `docs/automated_example_gallery.md`.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for at least 95% test coverage for new code
- Include edge cases and error conditions in tests
